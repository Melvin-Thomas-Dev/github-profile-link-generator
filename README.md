# github-profile-link-generator

A simple link generator that generates GitHub profile URLs from the usernames. 
- The generator will output a text file containing the profile URLs
- The usernames must be input as an excel file.
- Copy the generator to the directory containing the excel file.
- The excel file can have any number of rows or columns. User can specify the column which has the usernames.
- The generator starts parsing from the 2nd row (Assuming that the 1st row contains titles).
- Feel free to open issues or pull requests ;-).
